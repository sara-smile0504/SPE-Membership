# SPE-Membership
Code utilized to clean SPE Membership data. The file was provided by the Society of Petroleum Engineers with all relevant membership data from the Midland, TX area. This dataset included members who are not currently living in the area in addition to some who may be inactive. 

The dataset also provided the elected primary technical domain of each member in addition to current employment history. A table with a foreign key had to be created to join all five sheets worth of data together. The other sheets included whether a person volunteered as a board member or published any relevant literature. 

The purpose of this project was to gain a greater understanding of the membership in the area to deliver relevant continuing education lectures.
